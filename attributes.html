List creation in html
->there are four types of list in html
1.ordered List
2.unordered List
3.description List
4.nested list 

ordered list - In ordered list we will have list items one by one in specific order manner such as numbers,
alphabets and roman letters

by default the order will be numbers
<ol type="1" >
        <li>Biriyani</li>
        <li>Pizza</li>
        <li>Dose</li>
        <li >Panipuri</li>
        <li>Idly</li>
</ol>

->with the help of type attribute we can change the order as well like by prividing values as 1,A,a,I,i

start="" - with this attribute we can decide the starting position of the order

reversed - reversed attribute is without value attribute which help us to make a list in reverse order


unordered list - this list we will define the list items in casual manner wih the specific symbols
<ul type="none">
        <li>Swift</li>
        <li>Lamborghini</li>
        <li>Thar</li>
        <li>Hycross</li>
</ul>

->by default the symbol will be disc
->And with the help of type attribute we can change the symbol into some other type such as circle ,square and none

Description list - description list we will use to define kind of description to some content (for the specific term one specific  description)
-> with the help of dt(description tag) and dd(description data tag) we will create this List

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Collin sir</b></dt>
        <dd>He is SQL trainner</dd>
        <dd>He is kind person</dd>
        <dt><i><b>Vijay sir</b></i></dt>
        <dd>He is Java trainner</dd>
        <dd>He is calm person</dd>
     </dl>

Nested list - a list inside another list is called as nested list. we can define any type of List
inside some other types out of all list we have


TABLE CREATION IN HTML

->table is logical structure of rows,column and cells to store the data i systamatic format
->to create table we will use table tag as an root tag and ir is paired tag
->to define table heading part and table body we will use thead and tbody tag respectively.
these two tags are optional to use

->to define heading content we will use th tag
->to define table data content we will use td tag

for example -

<table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>EID</th>
